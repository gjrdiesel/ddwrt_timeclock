# ddwrt_timeclock
I had a goal of using an older DDWRT router I had laying around as a time clock for our office.
Having to maintain a timesheet is frustrating when technology could be used to make it a trival task.

Unforunately we're busy doing other things besides finishing this, so the project is moving at a rather slow pace.

Included is an example.json file, and the DDWRT parser class has a 'USE_EXAMPLE' property so if you're like me 
don't have a DDWRT router at home to use to experiment you can use the example instead.

In our case, we have a rasberry pi (we use as a dashboard) we'll run this completed script on and intially post it 
to our company website to display within our dashboard, but I may EVENTUALLY further this script to keep track
of connected clients entirely.

# ddwrt? rasberry pi? why?
These are things we had laying around and we're using already.

# python?
Yeah... I don't have much experience with it, this is my hello-world project for python.
